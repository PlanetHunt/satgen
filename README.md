# YFROST (Your FRiendly pythOn Space Toolkit)
YFROST is a new a new toolkit for space related calculation and simulations. At this moment it supports space debris mitigation and Cubesat orbit propagation.

## Difference to other mitigation tools
YFROST uses GA(Genetic Algorithm) to find the highest (lowset) orbit possible for a given satellite. It is as a matter of kind of reverse engineering tool. It helps you decide for an orbit only an hand of your satellite size and characteristics.
