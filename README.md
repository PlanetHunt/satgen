# YFROST - Your FRiendly pythOn Space Toolkit
YFROST is a new toolkit for space related calculation and simulations. At the moment it supports space debris mitigation analysis and satellite orbit propagation.

## Difference to other mitigation tools
YFROST uses GA (Genetic Algorithm) to find the highest (lowset) orbit possible for a given satellite. It is as a matter of fact, kind of reverse engineering tool. It helps you decide for an orbit only an hand of your satellite size and characteristics.

## Orbit propagation and mitigation
At this moment the tool it self doesn't contain any orbit propagation or mitigation tool. It uses two STELA (Developed by CNES) and MASTER (Developed by ESA) for this purpose. Both of these tool are standard for this mean and freely available to download (look at the download section). Sadly both of them are closed source with STELA has the mathematical concept comprehensively declared in user manual. In future releases the propagation will also be included using python numpy.
